h1. Monetra-Ruby

This is the unofficial github repo for the "monetra-ruby" library originally developed by Integrum Technologies, LLC in 2006.  The
project can still be found on RubyForge (http://rubyforge.org/projects/monetra-ruby/).

This library provides a lightweight interface to the Monetra payment processing system (previously MVCE).

h2. Usage

Most of the usage can be ascertained by looking through lib/monetra.rb.  It's fairly self-explanatory.  For a quick example of a test
sale transaction, see test/test.rb
